# Python Project-12 Integrate ChatGPT with Jarvis

Welcome to Part 4 of our series on designing Jarvis in Python! In this video, we take our virtual assistant to the next level by integrating ChatGPT, allowing Jarvis to have more advanced conversational capabilities.

## In this tutorial, we will:
- Review the progress made in the previous parts of the series.
- Install the OpenAI Python client and set up the API key.
- Implement the code to connect Jarvis with ChatGPT.
- Add logic to handle conversations between the user and Jarvis using ChatGPT.
